  <div class="text">
    <div class="body">Typefaces are an essential resource employed by graphic designers, just as glass, stone, steel, and other materials are employed by architects. Graphic designers sometimes create their own typefaces and custom lettering. More commonly, however, they tap the vast library of existing typefaces, choosing and combining them in response to a particular audience or situation. To do this with wit and wisdom requires knowledge of how—and why—letterforms have evolved.
    </div>

    <p1 class="topic">Words originated as gestures of the body. The first typefaces were directly modeled on the forms of calligraphy Typefaces, however, are not bodily gestures—they are manufactured images designed for infinite repetition. 
    </p1>

    <div class="body">The history of typography reflects a continual tension between the hand and the machine, the organic and the geometric, the human body and the abstract system. These tensions, which marked the birth of printed letters over five hundred year ago, continue to energize typography today. Movable type, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in Germany in the early fifteenth century, revolutionized writing in the West. Whereas scribes had previously manufactured books and documents by hand, printing with type allowed for mass production: large quantities of letters could be cast from a mold and assembled into “forms.” After the pages were proofed, corrected, and printed, the letters were put away in gridded cases for reuse.

    <p1 >In fifteenth-century Italy, humanist writers and scholars rejected gothic scripts in favor of the lettera antica, a classical mode of handwriting with wider, more open forms.

Movable type had been employed earlier in China but had proven less useful there. Whereas the Chinese writing system contains tens of thousands of distinct characters, the Latin alphabet translates the sounds of speech into a small set of marks, making it well-suited to mechanization.

    <p1 >Renaissance artists sought standards of proportion in the idealized human body. The French designer and typographer Geofroy Tory published a series of diagrams in 1529 that linked the anatomy of letters to the anatomy of man.
    </p1>

    <div class="body">Many typefaces we use today, including Garamond, Bembo, Palatino, and Jenson, are named for printers who worked in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. These typefaces are generally known as “humanist.” Contemporary revivals of historical typefaces are designed to conform with modern technologies and current demands for sharpness and uniformity. Each revival responds to—or reacts against—the production methods, printing styles, and artistic habits of its own time. Some revivals are based on metal types, punches (steel prototypes), or drawings that still exist; most rely solely on printed specimens. Italic letters, also introduced in fifteenth-century Italy, were modeled on a more casual style of handwriting. While the upright humanist scripts appeared in expensively produced books, the cursive form thrived in the cheaper writing shops, where it could be written more rapidly than the carefully formed lettera antica. 
    </div>

    <p1 >Some designers viewed the distortion of the alphabet as gross and immoral, tied to a destructive and inhumane industrial system. Writing in 1906, Edward Johnston revived the search for an essential, standard alphabet and warned against the “dangers” of exaggeration. 
    </p1>

    <div class="body">  Johnston, inspired by the nineteenth-century Arts and Crafts movement, looked back to the Renaissance and Middle Ages for pure, uncorrupted letterforms. Although reformers like Johnston remained romantically attached to history, they redefined the designer as an intellectual distanced from the commercial mainstream. The modern design reformer was a critic of society, striving to create objects and images that would challenge and revise dominant habits and practices. The avant-garde artists of the early twentieth century rejected historical forms but adopted the model of the critical outsider. Members of the De Stijl group in the Netherlands reduced the alphabet to perpendicular elements. At the Bauhaus, Herbert Bayer and Josef Albers constructed letters from basic geometric  forms—the circle, square, and triangle—which they viewed as elements of a universal language of vision. Such experiments approached the alphabet as a system of abstract relationships.

    <p1 class="topic">Reflection</p1>

    <div class="body">Thinking with Type is assembled in three sections: letter, text, and grid, building from the basic atom of the letterform to the organization of words into coherent bodies and flexible systems. Each section opens with a narrative essay about the cultural and theoretical issues that fuel typographic design across a range of media. The demonstration pages that follow each essay show not just how typography is structured, but why, asserting the functional and cultural basis for design habits and conventions. Throughout the book, examples of design practice demonstrate the elasticity of the typographic system, whose rules can all be broken.
