    <div class="title"> Graphic Design 101</div>
</div>


    <div class="body">We are here to take you through the fundamental elements of graphic design. Starting with an exciting journey through “Everyday Color Theory” where you will understand the history of color, how colors are perceived, experienced, how it evokes different sensibilities, how it blends in, stands out, and express itself through the medium of light. 
    </div>

    <div class="body">Then, moving to typography, where you get exposed to “Thinking with Type” which covers three major sections- Letter, Type and Grid. Here you can go through examples of design practices, type crimes, do’s and don’ts of type. 
    </div>

    <div class="body">Color, typography, form and purpose are at the heart of how we perceive things, and as graphic designers we need to be mindful of how we use it to express our work. Happy reading!
